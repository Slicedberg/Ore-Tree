Welcome to the Official Ore Tree Guide!
This guide was written by the creator of the mod, Slicedberg. It is currently fully updated!

CHAPTER 1: STONE (Beginning -> Unlocking Coal)
    - You start the game generating 0.1 points/second.
    - You can reset for stone at 1 point.
    - After resetting, you can buy the first stone upgrade, which multiplies points by 1.5.
    - Pro Tip: If playing on PC, you can hold down 'S' to automatically buy Stone ASAP. You can see all hotkeys by clicking the i icon on the left of the screen.
    - For now, the game is quite simple. Just reset for stone as soon as possible and buy upgrades.
    - A bit after buying 'Reinforced Foundation', it is slightly more effective to reset every 0.5 seconds instead of holding 'S', but it is inconsistent for now.
    - Buyables can be bought multiple times. You can buy them every tick by holding your click.
    - I recommend you grind for 'Finally, Boosting Stone!' when you have 13 Point Amplifiers, then buy 'Point Quadrupler'.
    - Buy 'Double Trouble' when you have 20 Point Amplifiers and 'Two in One' at 25.
    - The second buyable doesn't complicate things too much, just keep buying buyables ASAP. (from now on, a good point to grind for the next upgrade is when both buyables's costs are over half of the upgrades' cost.)
    - After 'Cheaper Buyables', resetting for stone every 0.5-1 second is way more effective and encouraged.
    - You will eventually max out buyables. There are ways to increase this limit, but it's recommended to look for other ways to progress after maxing them. (For now, that's unlocking the 3rd buyable.)
    - After unlocking Warehouses, just grind buyables and upgrades until Coal.

CHAPTER 2: COAL+MILESTONES (Unlocking Coal -> Unlocking Challenges)
    - Resetting for coal will reset all of your stone, stone upgrades, and stone buyables. Trust me though, it's worth it (and also the only way to progress).
    - Reset for coal as soon as possible and buy 'Do It Again'. You now have to re-do the entire stone layer, but this time it'll be around 4x faster. Don't stop yet, there's plenty more to come.
    - When you reach 'In The Name' again, you'll see it's effect has changed. This will send your production to new heights!
    - DO NOT RESET for Coal until you can gain 5 in one reset! Buy 'Triple Trouble' with it.
    - You'll max out stone buyables on your third coal run, but you can unlock a new stone upgrade that doubles warehouse limits with 'Eye for an Eye'. Make sure you get all of the coal in 1 reset, like last time.
    - The next coal upgrade costs a lot, so make sure to get all 3 new upgrades. Grind for about 35,000 coal so 'Coal-Point Catalyst' is more effective when you buy it.
    - Grind for about 400,000 coal before resetting and buying 'Coal-Stone Catalyst' so the coal catalsyts are stronger.
    - The newest stone upgrade will unlock MileStones, which are a key factor in progression MileStones reset the same things Coal does.
    - You may be tempted to reset for coal to make catalysts stronger, but it's more effective to get the second milestone which unlocks another row of Coal upgrades first.
    - Reset and buy the next coal upgrade at around 9 million coal.
    - Keep griding milestones and coal. The next coal upgrade is faster to get in 2 resets instead of one, both for 35-50 million coal. 
    - When you get 5 MileStones, progress will speed up significantly. Keep getting milestones until until you can buy 'Polished Coal Catalysts' in 1 reset.
    - You might want to reset for 3e9 coal at 8 MileStones so catalysts are stronger. 'Grin-D' will require 2 more resets, around 5e9 each.
    - After you get 10 MileStones, unlock milestone upgrades with 'Kilometerstones'.
    - Do not buy Challenging right away. Max out the stone layer before buying the upgrade and jump back up to 10 MileStones in one reset.

CHAPTER 3: CHALLENGES (Unlocking Challenges -> Unlocking Lead/Iron)
    - Challenges are explained in-game. When you unlock the first challenge, get 4 completions before anything else.
    - For now, just keep getting milestones and completing challenges until you can buy coal upgrades in 1-2 resets.
    - The Is It Worth It? (IIWI) upgrades are, in fact, worth it, and you should buy them as soon as possible.
    - At 15 Milestones, you'll start to keep buyables! Remember that you only keep them, so you'll still have to buy more when the cap goes up.
    - Make sure that when you buy IIWI IV you have at least 16 MileStones and around 7 challenge completions. Don't worry if you bought it before, it won't slow progress too much.
    - Get WIWAWI (yes, that's what it's called) with 3-4 resets to remove all penalties. It's faster to get this right after IIWI IV and 7 challenge completions.
    - Get  18 MileStones and get all 10 completions of 'Anti-Upgrade' and 19 MileStones.
    - When you complete 'Anti-Upgrade', you'll unlock a new challenge, 'Unbuyable'. Get 8 completions right away. Since challenges do an MS reset, it'll be faster to do multiple completions at a time in the future.
    - Now, reset for MS so you get over 20 and buy 'Another 10 Later'.
    - You start with 2 coal buyables. 'Autostone' is stronger early on, but focus 'Challenge Compressor' when grinding Milestones.
    - Go back to grinding MileStones and challenges until you can get coal upgrades in 1-2 resets. make sure to get some coal for buyables.
    - After 2 coal upgrades and 28 MileStones, get 20 'Unbuyable' completions and get 'New Processor Unit' and 'Permastone'. All you have to worry about in Stone is getting buyables when the cap goes up.
    - From now on, getting to the next layer is simple. Do a few resets for 'Grin-D-er' and do more completions. when you get 'YAPU', grind completions until 36 MileStones.
    - All you need to do now is get MileStones, buy coal buyables, and do 'Unbuyable' completions. When you get 40 MileStones, you can buy More Ores.

    CHAPTER 4: EARLY LEAD/IRON (Unlocking Lead/Iron -> Completing One of 2)
