CHAPTER 1: STONE (Beginning -> Unlocking Coal)
    - You start the game generating 0.1 points/second.
    - You can reset for stone at 1 point.
    - After resetting, you can buy the first stone upgrade, which multiplies points by 1.5.
    - Pro Tip: If playing on PC, you can hold down 'S' to automatically buy Stone ASAP. You can see all hotkeys by clicking the i icon on the left of the screen.
    - For now, the game is quite simple. Just reset for stone as soon as possible and buy upgrades.
    - A bit after buying 'Reinforced Foundation', it may become more effective to wait ~half a second before resetting for stone to get more. (This is true around 500 stone).
    - Buyables can be bought multiple times. You can buy them every tick by holding your click.
    - I recommend you grind for 'Finally, Boosting Stone!' when you have 13 Point Amplifiers, then buy 'Point Quadrupler'.
    - Buy 'Double Trouble' when you have 20 Point Amplifiers and 'Two in One' at 25.
    - The second buyable doesn't complicate things too much, just keep buying buyables ASAP.
